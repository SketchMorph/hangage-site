  "story": "Clothes carry the spirit of people.\nWhat we create goes beyond simply being worn; it becomes, for both the wearer and the viewer, a beginning to reveal oneâ€™s identity.\nThat beginning is the most beautiful way to express oneself, and when these colors come together, they ultimately form a culture shared by individuals and communities alike.\nHanGage does not follow fast fashion or capital-driven sameness, but creates garments that reflect the unique colors and stories of each nation and each individual."
